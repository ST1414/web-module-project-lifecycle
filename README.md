# GitHub Grabber

A small project that pulls GitHub user information and displays a users followers.  GitHub handles can be searched directly, or followers can be clicked to load their profile and followers.  This was built in JS and React, using class components and lifecycle methods.  Some styling was added via CSS to create a clean and simple UI with shadow boxes.
